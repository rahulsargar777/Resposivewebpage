  <div class="titl"><h1>Kia Carens</h1></div>
  <p>What the Kia EV6 does best is take the time spent between driving a fully-electric vehicle between charges and makes it worthwhile. Without tangling its owners into the scientific experiment of owning an EV, the EV6 provides a pleasant ride, good performance, and a spacious cabin. Its distractingly cool-dude styling is meaningful and makes this Kia SUV look like something special rather than like everything else. For range, the EV6 offers as much as 310 EPA-estimated miles. For fun, the EV6 GT performance version blasts off with 576 horsepower. With a peak DC-fast charging rate of about 225 kW, the EV6 re-juices quickly, making it an easier way to travel long distances on electricity. </p>
  <h2>Infotainment and Connectivity</h2>
  <p>The infotainment system runs through a 12.0-inch touchscreen that's an extension of the EV6's 12.0-inch digital gauge cluster. However, the design and performance of the menu structure and navigation are unimpressive. Along with the ability to accept over-the-air updates and respond to myriad voice commands, the system includes popular features such as Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, wireless smartphone charging, and a Wi-Fi hotspot. Additionally, the stereo can be upgraded to a Meridian unit with 14 speakers.</p>
  <h2>Interior, Comfort, and Cargo</h2>
  <p>The EV6's design and layout are not as daring on the inside as the outside, but the configuration and features look attractive and futuristic. Although the center console doesn't slide back and forth and there are no front-seat footrests like there are on the Ioniq 5, the EV6 mixes high-tech content such as a digitized dashboard with practical elements such as a floating center console with copious storage solutions and a large bin underneath it. Other touches that stand out are the two-tone, two-spoke steering wheel, the prominent start button on the center console, and the tastefully placed gold accents throughout the cockpit. The EV6 has a flat floor and a wheelbase as long as the three-row, mid-size Kia Telluride, so passenger space is generous. There are also 28 cubic feet of cargo space behind the back seat and 54 cubes total with the rear seatbacks folded flat. There's more storage space under the front trunk too, but it's not as big as expected.</p>
